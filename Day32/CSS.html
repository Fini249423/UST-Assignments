      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.

    <p>

      This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

      HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

    Good day,

Thanks to the help of stackoverflow users for which I am very grateful, I have successfully implemented a click on a button to navigate to and display a separate section. The following code is working absolutely fine:

    <br><br><br>

    <a href="#top"><img src="D:\Dot Net\Day32\images\top.png" height="70" width="70" align="right"></a>

  </body>
